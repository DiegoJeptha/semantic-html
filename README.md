# Address

The `<address>` element is like `<time>` in that it doesnâ€™t deal with the overall structure of a document, but rather embellishes the parent `<article>` or `<body>` element with some metadata. 

It defines contact information for the author of the article or web page in question. 

`<address>` should not be used for arbitrary physical addresses.
