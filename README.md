# Dates and Times

For humans, dates and times come in many forms. You can refer to January 3rd, 2017 as “1/3/2017”, “Jan 3rd”, or even “yesterday” depending on the current date. Parsing this kind of ambiguous natural language is difficult and error-prone for machines, which is where `<time>` comes in.
