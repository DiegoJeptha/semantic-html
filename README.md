# Semantic HTML

This is where all the branches comes together.

I used [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html) as a great reference.

Please refer to the branches as a section for what you need to know.

Check out the README.md file on each branch to find out more information.
