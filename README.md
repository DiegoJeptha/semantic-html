# Divs for Layout

You should use semantic HTML whenever you can, since it helps machines infer the structure of your content, and it gives you a standardized vocabulary to organize your web pages.

However, sometimes you need a container element when none of the semantic HTML elements we just covered would make sense. 

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using a plain old <div> purely for layout purposes.
